I'm Wendy Ju, a UIUX designer based in NYC, who's passionate about creating digital experiences through problem-solving. I'm all about combining visual design with product thinking to bring meaningful experiences alive.



I'm a UI UX Designer and illustrator
based in Tel Aviv.
I enjoy creating user centric, delightful,
and human experiences.

            I create notable experiences for digital products, with a strong passion for design strategy, illustration, typography and storytelling.

After, leveraging a successful career in architecture, I strive to emphasise user’s needs and behaviours while balancing them with the clients’ business needs.

My strengths are my creativity, bringing ideas to the table, putting myself in the user’s shoes and solving issues that at first seem impossible.
